This is the [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) Console, based on the [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products). It provides a default configuration to get started with logs and metrics monitoring with ELK as well as some nice dashboards.

Please refer to the [JHipster Monitoring Documentation](http://jhipster.github.io/monitoring) for instructions on how to set up the JHipster Console.
